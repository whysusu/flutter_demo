flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/img_bottom_index_select_v2.png
    - images/img_bottom_mess_select_v2.png
    - images/img_bottom_my_select_v2.png
    - images/img_bottom_index_v2.png
    - images/img_bottom_mess_v2.png
    - images/img_bottom_my_v2.png
    - images/img_search_tag.png
